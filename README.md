# Welcome to the Restaurant Reservation System

The Restaurant Reservation System (RRS) is my implementation of a project I came up with for the students' class project as the Head TA for Georgia Tech’s Object Oriented Programming class, designed specifically to simulate an optimal dining experience through an intelligent approach to reservations management. By incorporating sophisticated software technology, RRS makes it easier for customers to book tables at their preferred restaurants, ensuring a smooth and efficient process from booking through dining. For restaurant owners, RRS is an invaluable tool that aids in maximizing table turnover while minimizing customer wait times. This dual advantage not only enhances customer satisfaction but also drives higher revenue. The system's intuitive interface and robust backend ensure reliability and scalability, catering to everything from small eateries to large dining establishments.

## System Design and Features
The system required students to architect a multi-functional platform that could handle various aspects of restaurant operations, starting with the ability to reserve tables of differing capacities. This functionality allowed customers to select a table appropriate for their party size directly from the interface. Students further enhanced the reservation experience by incorporating features that let customers order menu items in varying quantities. 

Students were tasked with developing the logic to calculate the total bill for each order, process payments by deducting funds from customer accounts, and accurately update the restaurant’s revenue. This component of the project emphasized the importance of accurate data handling and transactional integrity in software development.

To foster customer loyalty and enhance occupancy during off-peak hours, another implementation was allowing customers to earn credits or discounts when they choose to dine during less busy hours or on specific days. This feature not only encourages diners to return but also helps restaurants maintain a steady flow of patrons by balancing demand throughout the week.

After dining, customers are prompted to rate their experience and provide feedback via the system. This feature allows restaurant owners to gather valuable insights into customer satisfaction and areas of improvement. The aggregated data from reviews helps prospective diners make choices based on reliable peer feedback, while restaurateurs use this information to refine their service and offerings.

## Advanced Features and Learning Outcomes
One of the more complex features involved tracking the popularity of menu items across different restaurants. This feature not only provided valuable business insights but also served as an excellent example of how OOP can be used to manage and manipulate data effectively. Through this task, students explored advanced OOP concepts like polymorphism, where methods behaved differently based on the menu item type or restaurant context.

The project culminated in a highly successful outcome, with students not only meeting the basic requirements but also adding innovative features to their systems. Many groups introduced loyalty programs for repeat customers, which involved creating systems to track customer visits and provide rewards. Others developed custom billing logic to handle various discount strategies, enhancing the system’s utility and customer appeal.
