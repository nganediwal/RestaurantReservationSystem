# Welcome to the Restaurant Reservation System

This is a project I came up with for the students' class project as the Head TA for Georgia Tech’s Object Oriented Programming class. The system required students to implement several key features. They had to build functionality to reserve tables of different capacities, allowing customers to choose based on party size. They also gave customers the ability to order items in varying quantities, adjusting availability dynamically. The system calculated the total bill for each order, deducted funds from the customer's account, and updated the restaurant’s revenue accordingly. Students also developed more complex features like tracking the most popular menu items across restaurants which emphasized OOP principles like encapsulation/polymorphism. 
The project’s outcome was highly successful. Students not only implemented the required features but also extended the system by adding their own enhancements, such as loyalty programs and custom billing logic.
